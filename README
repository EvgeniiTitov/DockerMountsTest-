Dasha, to run the thing, we need to make sure that we can communicate with the
isolated docker container. We need to be able to:
1. Provide images to process
2. Get the results back

To do so, we need to mount two volumes:
folder with images on your machine -> the appropriate folder inside
the container (the one where the code expects to find images).
The same needs to be done with the folder where results will be saved.

Pull the image, run with:
``docke run --rm -it -v path/to/images/onyour/machine:/app/source 
-v path/to/where/find/results/onyour/machine:/app/result <image_name:tag>``
